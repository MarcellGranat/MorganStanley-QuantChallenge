The enclosed data was loaded and exported into a private OneDrive folder. Additionally, all intermediate results were saved in the same folder using the [{pins}](https://pins.rstudio.com) package. If you would like access to the folder, please email [granat.marcell\@uni-neumann.hu](mailto:granat.marcell@uni-neumann.hu). There is a chance that you do not have access to the folder, or that you have but in another way. In this case, it may be necessary that the `.board` object created in the script must be modified accordingly.
